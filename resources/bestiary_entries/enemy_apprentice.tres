description = "After being initiated into the Imperial Academy of Sorcery as a Zelator, and absorbing enough arcane knowledge to burst the skull of a lesser scholar, one can pass from the rank of Theoricus to Practicus. At this stage of their education, students are tasked with going out into the world and applying their knowledge in a number of real-world situations, proving their mastery of the basics of their occult sciences.

While this, in theory, encourages the students of the Academy to perform good deeds, a number instead stay in the Imperial City and ply their theorems in the arena instead. For most, this is a low-risk, low-energy way to fulfill their coursework requirements while also gaining notoriety and status among the Imperial court and the arena industrial complex.

The most esteemed of the wizards in the arena have as many as a dozen recorded kills. However, the Practicus are as a rule cowardly. Few of them have the steel will required to fire off a spell while an enemy is right up in their face, wailing on them with whatever rusted equipment the quartermasters tossed the condemned in the moments before the match began."
