description = "Hailing from the southern reaches of the Mizakk jungles, these dog-sized bats are notorious for their savagery and hunger for blood.

Shadow Bats, so named for their ability to move with absolute silence through the dark of the night, were once the proud symbol of the Nacretian Dynasties. As all school-aged children know, the Nacretians fell in a single night beneath the mighty power of Dark Lord Gareth and his unstoppable, divine-gifted authority, their ruins destined to become the foundation for the Imperial City.

It is likely not a coincidence that these shadow bats, once noble guard beasts and companions, have been relegated to the second-lowest rung of Imperial society (slightly edging out the failed wizard)."
