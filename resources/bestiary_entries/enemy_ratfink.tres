description = "Though they may appear to be slightly larger, slightly paler versions of their vicious sewer-dwelling brethren, the ratfink is actually a notorious imperial double agent.

Charmed by cunning vermomancers, these rats go through legendarily grueling training to master spycraft, diplomacy, and subterfuge. 

Usage of ratfinks is normally reserved for rooting out countercultural elements in the Empire, whether that be non-sanctioned religious activity or political activism. However, from time to time, they can be spotted participating in gladiatorial executions. It is unknown if this is part of some new top-secret training regimen, or if some other motive is behind their entry into the arena."
