description = "By way of incompetent zoning and city planning, the battle arena Lord Gareth uses for executions happens to sit directly atop a network of old sewer lines. In addition to giving the convicted's final moments the distinct background aroma of raw, feculent sewage, this has a darker, more horrible effect. 

As the rats swarm in a tide of living fur and fangs, drawn by the trumpets of battle and smell of fresh meat, the convicted invariably feels a rush of hope as the vermin fall by the dozen to the crude weaponry granted them by the quartermasters. Once the real battle begins, that hope slips deliciously away."
