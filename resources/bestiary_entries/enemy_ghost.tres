description = "Little known to most of the populace, a blind hag appeared before Lord Gareth many years ago. She spoke a prophecy that a child born that very year in the lands of Eshem would bring an end to his reign. After having the hag flayed, Gareth set about a campaign of terror. All children in Eshem were gathered up and executed en masse, thus putting an end to fate's silly notions of regicide.

It is ironic that the souls of those murdered children would choose to begrudge the actual hero instead of their murderer. Then again, this was never their fight in the first place."
