description = "A particularly vicious specimen from Lord Gareth's menagerie, this razor crab underwent experimental embiggening and enhancement at the Academy. The result was a resounding success.

With plating as hard as steel, claws as sharp as any blade ever forged, and the ability to conjure a storm of magical energy to strip the flesh from its victim, there is no more fearsome creature to face in the arena."
