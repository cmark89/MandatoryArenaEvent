description = "Yea, we have never been more free
Than in this city built with bone and gold
We are grateful, O Lord
We are grateful

Lift me up on ivory wings
So I may see all the lands you rule
And the ruins of those who refused
Your mercy, O Lord
Your mercy

We give thanks that you raise the sun
We give thanks that you wove the stars
We drink your gift and plenty every day
We live for you, O Lord
We live for you"
